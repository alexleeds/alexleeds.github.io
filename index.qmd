## Hello and welcome!

I'm a data scientist who explores consumer behavior. I use a mix of computationally intensive methods, experiments, and human feedback to refine growth tactics: product/feature selection, ads, pricing, conversion, and market segmentation.

Until April 2024, I was the CEO and Co-founder of [Sleuth](https://about.hellosleuth.com/). Sleuth was an app and website that provided running feedback to parents about their kidsâ€™ development using machine learning and data covering 250 topics. As part of this work, more than 60,000 parents contributed answers to 1.25 million questions between 2022 and 2023. 

Before Sleuth, I managed data science teams at [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) and One Zero Capital and was a Data Scientist in Residence at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/). I have a BA from Yale University in Political Science and a PhD in a mix of economics, statistics, and applied psychology from Wharton Business School.

## Personal life

I live in New York City on the Upper East Side with my wife, daughter and [two vocal cats](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxz-7J6pzJs/).

In my free time, I enjoy reading biographies, swimming (badly), and [coding projects](/projects/) for pure entertainment. I also created and lightly oversee a meetup called [NYC AI Hackers](https://www.meetup.com/ai-hackers/) that runs events exploring data science and AI applications.
