**Comments**

I'll keep this vague to avoid spoilers:

- This book was recommended by Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, in his [April 12, 2024 interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-dario-amodei.html) with Ezra Klein.

- It's no surprise that the novel became the basis for a Syfy and Amazon Prime Video series (which I haven't seen). It has propulsive storytelling and space opera visuals of the sort that would translate to the screen.

- The plot follows the usual "small to grand scale" arc as its main characters get swept up in transformational events across the future inhabited solar system. 

- Like so much good sci-fi, the main characters (Holden leading his ice-hauling crew and Miller, the cop) were heroically "good": persistant, brave, kind, and fair as well as humorously rebellious. They're the usual [hero with a thousand faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces).

- The creepy things were extremely creepy. A+ for goulishness. 

- I liked the fact that the characters were casually clever. Miller's brilliance is never presented as a central part of his personality. In fact, he just refers to himself as someone who had once been an effective cop. Yet, his creative problem solving is a thread that runs through the story.

- This book does not deviate from male-centered tropes of sci-fi. The two main female characters were love interests of the two main male characters and all of the significant leadership were men. The women do at least play pivotal roles. 

- There is an assumption that everyone in the story makes about the aim of the "protomolecule" that seemed like a strange leap to me.

- I loved the surprises. There was one twist you will see coming from hundreds of pages away (but still enjoy) but lots that kept me glued.

Overall, this is a good beach read. I probably *will* read more of the series on the beach this summer.
