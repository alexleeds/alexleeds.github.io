Amor Towles is best known for *A Gentleman in Moscow*, the fictional account of a Russian aristocrat imprisoned in a high-end hotel by the Bolsheviks. *A Gentleman in Moscow* has a fast pace, sharp dialogue and terrific humor, and it is no surprise that it appears on many “Best Books of XYZ” lists.

By comparison, I found the short stories in *Table for Two* more polarizing. Some (“Hasta Luego”, “The Bootlegger”, “Eve in Hollywood”) were excellent. Others (“The Line”, “The Ballad of Timothy Touchett”, and “I Will Survive”) were disappointing.

Towles’s best characters - such as Count Rostov in *A Gentleman in Moscow* and Eve in a *Table for Two* - are flawless. Like the heroes of your favorite action flick, they overcome every obstacle with flair. Eve is so far ahead of everyone around her that she outwits them, charms them, and astonishes adversaries by appearing exactly where she needs to be. Towles makes Eve perfectly attractive as well. He gives her with a noticeable scar on her face as though to qualify this absurdity.

Towles doesn’t bend to the standard that characters must suffer in “good” fiction. Flawless characters are fun. And Eve’s combination of goodness, omniscience, and dominance is even better in print, capering for 200 pages of Table for Two across 1930s Los Angeles, than it would be on the screen. 

This makes some of his other stories so much less appealing. In “The Ballad of Timothy Touchett,” Towles expresses an oozing disdain for inept writers. The same disdain appears in different guises for the characters in “The Line” and “I Will Survive.” When he writes about people whose failings lead to tragic ends, he can’t hide his pleasure in punishing human weaknesses. Some people might like it, but I find this boring.

Towles is better off when his characters have sympathetic flaws (“Hasta Luego” and “The Bootlegger”). In both of these stories, the protagonists are married to spouses who love them anyway. And, as though depicting that love makes him more tolerant, Towles produces more moving stories.

*Table for Two* is easy to recommend. My least favorite stories were still entertaining. And “Eve in Hollywood” was both the best and the full second half of the book. As a New Yorker, I also enjoyed the familiar scenes from Central Park to Brooklyn to LaGuardia Airport so clearly represented by a local.
