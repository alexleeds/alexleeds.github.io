  <title>Will Chris Dixon Fall from Grace?</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Leeds</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>If you ever wanted to observe someone fall from the absolute height of an exclusive financial field, the venture capitalist Chris Dixon seems to be an unusually visible case.</p>
<p>Dixon was the 2022 leader of Forbes’s Midas List of best-performing VCs. His track record as a VC is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2022/04/12/midas-list-chris-dixon-crypto-capitalist/?sh=3b6072d05209">consistently excellent</a>: Kickstarter, Pinterest, Stripe, Oculus! He topped the Midas List on the back of his early investment in Coinbase, an outstanding success despite its latest <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-sues-coinbase-says-it-is-unregistered-broker-dealer-95ec0637">political travails</a>.</p>
<p>Dixon came to my attention in 2015 with his blog post, <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">“Come for the tool, stay for the network”</a>. It was such a great thesis about how Internet 2.0 companies like Instagram caught on: come for the camera filters, stay for the photo sharing. His lucid blogging was part of his claim to fame. I greatly admire his work.</p>
<p>So how did someone with so much good sense end up writing <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/blockchain-culture-computer-vs-casino/">stuff like this</a>? It reminds me of David French’s recent article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/opinion/republican-partisan-world-view.html">“I was a Republican Partisan”</a>. During Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, David says that political conservatives…</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Created a parallel universe where Romney was leading, and many people at most senior levels of the campaign believed that mainstream polls were wrong and Romney would win — including, reportedly, even the candidate himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I was in Boston at the Romney party on election night, and when Fox News called Ohio for Obama, there was a palpable sense of shock, followed almost immediately by denial. I remember fielding emails in the days and weeks after the election from angry Republicans who wondered, even then, if Obama had cheated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I have to add the requisit caveat that groupthink is not unique to Republicans. Biden’s re-election camapaign is reportedly making the exact same mistake right now.)</p>
<p>Blockchains were supposed to provide the benefits of anonymity in record keeping (for monetary exchange, contracts, or software apps) with the resiliency of a distributed network. Instead, it turned out that: (1) Most people do not need or want 100% anonymity unless they have criminal intent. (2) It is easier and 100x faster to support anonymous authentication through other cryptographic systems. And (3) while blockchains may be distributed, private companies aiming to profit from them are usually centralized, leading to central points of weakness and cascading failures.</p>
<p>Dixon’s writing shows the same disconnection from reality that David French described above. Dixon tries to explain:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Two distinct cultures are interested in blockchains. The first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks. I call this culture the computer because, at its core, it’s about blockchains powering a new computing movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The other culture is mainly interested in speculation and money-making. Those of this mindset see blockchains solely as a way to create new tokens for trading. I call this culture the casino because, at its core, it’s really just about gambling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like a political campaign in denial about the polls.</p>
<p>A tool powering a new computing movement should support the foundations of computing itself: fast and slow data storage, data processing, data transport, software services, and instrumentation. Blockchains are - by definition - inefficient at every one of these. The distributed philosophy behind their form makes them a permanently inferior solution compared to a more direct implementation.</p>
<p>Molly White says in <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/">her review</a> of Dixon’s new book, <a href="https://readwriteown.com/"><em>Read Write Own</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a single blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes is when he speaks of how “for decades, technologists have dreamed of building a grassroots internet access provider”. He describes one project that “got further than anyone else”: Helium. He’s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project’s token to enrich themselves. But hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so might as well try to drum up some new interest!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great NYC companies like <a href="https://www.avalabs.org/">Ava Labs</a> that theoretically provide a platform for decentralized applications are - actually and necessarily - touting their solutions for “an NFT and crypto wallet extension” and an “asset wallet.” They have to cross over to the dark side. Meanwhile, NFTs have gone the way of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">tulips</a> (see <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/05/the-broke-ape-yacht-crash-lessons-for-justin-bieber-and-other-nft-collectors/">The Broke Ape Yacht Crash</a>). Coinbase, Dixon’s greatest success in this arena, belongs to what he now calls “the culture of the casino.”</p>
<p>As of May 2024, the value of the cash in cryptocurrencies was estimated to be $2.5 trillion. That is an attractive number. But break it down and we see: “1. Bitcoin (BTC) · $1.21 trillion ; 2. Ethereum (ETH) · $369 billion ; 3. Tether (USDT) · $110 billion ; 4. BNB (BNB) · $85 billion…” The wealth is crowding into Bitcoin, the first-generation blockchain product with the least utility, because pure speculation is the primary game.</p>
<p>Dixon insists on his blog, “Blockchains provide a sensible organizational structure for networks.” The problem with this sentence is the word “sensible.” He can’t honestly write, “the best” or “one of the best.” And he is always incredibly precise with his choice of words. Yet, how much confidence should we have in a technology whose leading advocate can only say it would be “sensible”?</p>
<p>Dixon raised a $4.5B crypto fund in 2022. I’ll be extremely curious to see how that plays out.</p>

  <title>Organizational Growth as a Navigation Problem</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Leeds</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexleeds.com/writing/org-growth/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I think about organizational growth in terms of <em>navigation</em> and <em>competition</em>. Navigation refers to how an organization steers through its environment toward opportunities. Competition refers to the strategies and tactics an organization uses to fight.</p>
<p>Competitive strategy might determine where an organization “goes” in the long term. But I think navigation is equally essential, and not fully covered by classic strategic analysis (five forces, flywheels, zero-to-one, etc).</p>
<p>When your product is better than the competition, you can get huge growth by exploiting your advantages to the hilt: growing into <em>open</em> territory. To do that, navigating requires a clear picture of the landscape, not competitive calculations. If you could only see the opportunity, then you would simply go there. And the difference of a few degrees in direction might be the difference between hitting a vein of gold or missing it completely. Or, more modestly, the benefit of shifting your worst 30% of ads to the performance of your best 30%.</p>
<p>Organizational navigation is like the mechanical navigation of a self-driving car: First, it needs to see and recognize the features of the environment. Therefore…</p>
<section id="navigating-in-2024" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="navigating-in-2024">Navigating in 2024</h2>
<p>To navigate places, you have to have good sensors.</p>
<p>For growth strategy, your sensors are measures of what potential customers want, what they learn or know about you (and respond to emotionally), and “where” they exist online and off. Most companies have strong intuitions about these but they don’t always measure them well.</p>
<p>The techniques are pretty straightforward. They include:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexleeds.com/writing/org-growth/methods_of_seeing.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>These techniques (very) roughly use these data inputs:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexleeds.com/writing/org-growth/methods_of_seeing_labeled.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>These are all standard, but there are four steps that take a concerted effort to really excel at these techniques:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Gather this data on a regular cadence.</strong></p>
<p>Certain “slow” measurements (e.g.&nbsp;interviews) might happen twice a year. Certain fast measurements might happen every hour. But it is important to have predictability in these feedback loops so that people embed the information in their operations. These need to be really smooth: the data should be at teams’ fingertips when they need it, if not automating tactics directly.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Capture the same data about your target markets and your existing customers.</strong></p>
<p>Organizations tend to research the their own customers or the market, but they rare collect the <em>same exact</em> metrics for representative samples of both.</p>
<p>With data about your target markets and your existing customers, you get obvious charts that look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexleeds.com/writing/org-growth/market_map1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The same chart of <em>penetration</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>promise</em> can be produced for <strong>verticals</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>interest in product features</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>geographic regions</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>media audience</strong> and it can be modified to consider marketing efficacy (CAC/LTV) in place of promise or scale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>penetration</strong> can be explored on its own through a chart that shows the % of highly likely customers in each vertical vs.&nbsp;the % of customers in each vertical who know about you (or prefer you).</p>
<p><strong>(3) Study the same dynamics across interviews, surveys, and quantitative data sets.</strong></p>
<p>It is classically true that interviews explain “why” someone might want or love your product but when, where, why, or how. That said, there are lots of established techniques for bridging interviews, surveys, and product data – but it requires planned coordination.</p>
<p>The payoff, of course, is that once you know what types of messaging consumers respond to (interviews), you can test those in your marketing material (experiments), and validate the impact on LTV (product data), and create feedback between techniques.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Your navigation must support your locomotion.</strong></p>
<p>The goal isn’t to change organizational behavior, it is to supercharge it.</p>
<p>Sticking with the “seeing where to go” analogy, we can consider the market’s response to two devices that want to change how people see things: the Facebook Quest VR headset and the Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>A strong signal of Apple Vision Pro’s promise is that people say they love using it for two specific activities: watching movies and reading email.</p>
<p>Facebook burnt billions of dollars trying to get people to do new things with Quest headsets, exploring their metaverse or playing new games. Meanwhile, Apple seems to have triumphed by producing a device that improves everyday lives. If everyday Americans will dump money on a home theater system, it isn’t such a stretch for them to buy the Vision Pro to make the same experience better.</p>
<p>Once people adopt the Apple Vision Pro for movies, or sports watching, or email, then the gateway opens to create new experiences. The same is true for growth feedback which can grow from optimization to real innovation.</p>

  <title>Magical Skills</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Barbara Corcoran of the Corcoran (real estate) Group <a href="https://twitter.com/BarbaraCorcoran/status/953716121470939137">recently tweeted</a>, “The hardest lesson to learn is that you are more capable than you think you are.”</p>
<p>I’ve often wondered about this: how do we hem ourselves in by our own expectations?</p>
<p>At a simplistic level, tons of research on <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_BurnetteOBoyleVanEppsPollackFinkel_PsychBull.pdf">implicit beliefs</a>, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/manuscript/2020-99903-019.pdf">growth mindset</a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martha-Carr-2/publication/38138977_Motivational_Components_of_Underachievement/links/54d3a5a10cf2b0c6146de654/Motivational-Components-of-Underachievement.pdf">underachievement</a> explores the basic idea: If we believe we can’t learn or do something - or just that our skills in some domain are inherited rather than acquired - then we don’t learn it.</p>
<p>But I’m interested in another layer of this problem: opportunities we miss because <em>almost no one</em> believes that a skill is possible for any individual or group. What about the limits we impose from lack of imagination rather than from lack of self-confidence?</p>
<section id="what-impossible-skills-are-actually-possible" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-impossible-skills-are-actually-possible">What “impossible” skills are actually possible?</h2>
<p>What if we lived in a world where long distance running had never been invented as a sport? Would we believe that a human could run 26 miles in under 4:36 seconds per mile? Probably not.</p>
<p>What if we lived in a world where professional musicians didn’t exist, and then imported Yuja Wang? Her performance would seem like magic: the memory of those hundreds of thousands of notes delivered with impossible control.</p>
<p>But there are abilities that most people would probably not imagine at all.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can hold our breath for more than 20 minutes (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-it-takes-to-hold-your-breath-for-24-minutes-yeah-its-a-thing/">Wired article</a> and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-limits-of-breath-holding/">Scientific American</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>We can <a href="https://www.worldmemorychampionships.com/spoken-numbers/">perfectly recall 500 single-digit numbers</a> having heard them listed only once.</p></li>
<li><p>Apollo Robbins can remove your watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkx-XzEkoHs">without your awareness</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/a-pickpockets-tale">even when you are trying to prevent him</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The most extreme examples <em>are</em> due to rare talent as well as extreme effort. But a fraction of thesse performances is achievable with concerted long-term effort yet just not “believable” by almost anyone.</p>
<p>Could we do the same with slightly more practical skills? Paul Ekman made a science out of reading people’s emotions (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emotions-Revealed-Second-Recognizing-Communication/dp/0805083391">Emotions Revealed</a>), for example. What could we do if we imagined other useful skills?</p>
<p>Imagine if we collected thousands of video clips from YouTube of just people…</p>
<ul>
<li>introducing themselves</li>
<li>making persuasive arguments</li>
<li>interrupting other people</li>
<li>defending a belief</li>
<li>making jokes classified by style</li>
</ul>
<p>How are these done well? When do they fail? This is now a feasible AI project.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-could-groups-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-could-groups-do">What could groups do?</h2>
<p>And what about groups? Most of our models for how people behave in social and work settings are based on limited scenarios and narrow comfort levels.</p>
<p>What if we took the hours, focus, and energy of a five-star restaurant kitchen staff and expected Facebook software developers to perform similarly? I think some of them might actually die from exhaustion before the week was over.</p>
<p>Could we change how people think about working as a team in professional settings? What if we really did cross software development with the skills/practical elements of other fields like restaurants, or sports, or concert music? What if we also tailored the workflows of different teams to more accurately reflect the kinds of outcomes t hey aim to produce?</p>
<p>Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/jensen-huang">recently made this argument</a>. He criticized engineering firms for adopting a generic pattern for organizational structure and functions. Similarly, I still see hospitals fighting (and failing) to overcome the departmental structure that has existed for decades. And many private equity firms still use approaches that Siegmund Warburg designed in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p>Our expectations for ourselves, for our professions, and for our societies are hide-bound. I’m not sure what to do about it, but I’m certain that we set our sights far too low.</p>
