<p>These are a handful of toy projects that I’m working on in the next 12 months. This is a brand new website, so I’ll gradually post more content as I get around to it. Most of these projects use some form of AI because there is just so much opportunity for exciting work using AI methods and tools.</p>

<p>What useful, fun, or interesting words exist in other languages but not in English?</p>
<p>Since the dawn of the Internet, people have published <a href="https://ihworld.com/news-blog/ih-blog/10-words-that-don-t-exist-in-english/">lists of words like this</a>.</p>
<p>We think in language, and so our vocabulary literally creates a bound on our ideas. I don’t have a strong desire to learn other languages right now, but I’m enthusiastic to expand the universe of words I have for concepts.</p>
<p>One approach for finding these words is to get a bunch of fluent speakers in non-English languages together and to ask them what is missing in English. But this is difficult to make comprehensive without a large time commitment by others or a large working group.</p>
<p>Now, LLMs have produced a beautiful solution to this problem through text embeddings. We can simply find words and phrases in other languages that are “distant” from English words in certain relevant dimensions and forms. It’s tricky to locate the patterns that identify useful and interesting words but very doable.</p>
<p>Once we have relevant lists, I think there are a bunch of other minor challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide definitions, some appropriate grammar (for an English speaker), and examples to make this practically useful</li>
<li>Organize the words - likely as in a thesaurus</li>
<li>As with all of these projects, open it up for others to contribute!</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently hosted a live, in-person, spoken debate between OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo and Google’s Gemini Pro on the topic: “Standardized testing should be abolished.”</p>
<p>OpenAI was randomly assigned the affirmative position and Gemini was assigned the negative position. The debate had the following format.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Opening Statements (2 minutes each)</li>
<li>Arguments (3 minutes)</li>
<li>Rebuttal (3 minutes)</li>
<li>Conclusion (2 minutes)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the debate, the audience and the AIs judged the winner.</p>
<p>Technically, these debates have three technical problems - all of them quite interesting: (1) How do we improve the responses AIs provide? For instance, they can search Internet references or use RAGs to retrieve the right material for a line of argument. (2) How do we turn AI responses into spoken audio? (text-to-speech) (3) How do we visualize the debate audio?</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/alexleeds/ai-debates">current implementation of these</a> is extremely rough - just enough to run a debate that people truly enjoyed.</p>

<section id="trends-in-aesthetics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trends-in-aesthetics">Trends in aesthetics</h3>
<p>We love things that are slightly different in style from products we already know. This influences our preferences in every art form: clothing, music, food, software, etc.</p>
<p>The corollary is also true: We dislike things that are too different.</p>
<p>This influences our preferences in every art form: clothing, music, food, software, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to create something that people will love - aesthetically - you usually have three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reversion: You can bring back a familiar style that is no longer current. This leads to well-known loops in aesthetics that often swing backward by ~20 to 30 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Combination: You can take aesthetics that people already appreciate in one sphere and apply them to another. Styles in clothing might be extended to rugs, upholstery, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Incremental Progress: We can slowly push the limits of preferences for speed or volume.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The fascinating thing about incremental trends in aesthetics, is that you might be able to see where they are going without being able to jump ahead to wherever they will be. People have to gradually adjust their preferences.</p>
<p>The frequency of cuts in movies will get faster or slower. Songs will get louder or quieter. Foods in some cuisines might get spicier. But audiences today are not ready for the preference that will follow 10 years from now. If someone made a song in the 1980s that was as loud as the current “loud” songs, no one would have liked them.</p>
<p>I wonder if we can find examples. How about…</p>
<p>Frequency of cuts in moving making? Number of spoken words/minute in songs? Loudness of songs? Preferences of spiciness in certain cuisines?</p>
<p>My first project in this space, however, is to look at trends in color palettes in commercial clothing. I’m capturing images of clothes from hundreds of design clothing companies’ archived websites and using neural nets to explore broad patterns in the clothings’ color schemes.</p>

<section id="general-purpose-ai-chess" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-purpose-ai-chess">General purpose AI chess</h3>
<p>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">IBM Deep Blue</a> in the 1980s (and, of course, earlier), chess has been a fun proving ground for computer problem solving.</p>
<p>I like testing the ability of generalist AI programs from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. to play chess because it isn’t something that naturally follows from the “provide the best next text” emphasis that was used to train these chat systems. They surely pick up chess data during training, but playing chess well is still a pretty specialized problem. It requires a demanding mix of memory, tactical, and strategic solutions that we think of as a distinct domain expertise.</p>
<p>The other great thing about chess is that we have incredibly strong chess engines like <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> that can be set for varying difficulty levels to allow us to test exactly how strong the AI programs currently are.</p>
<p>I’ve tested how well OpenAI performs at chess against Stockfish. Over time, I want to track the improvements in AI performance, pit them against each other, and explore these AIs’ abilities to reason about their own chess moves.</p>
