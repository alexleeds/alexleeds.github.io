    "text": "These are a handful of toy projects that I’m working on in the next 12 months. This is a brand new website, so I’ll gradually post more content about them as I get around to it. Most of these projects use some form of AI because there is just so much opportunity for exciting work using AI methods and tools.\n\nA universal lexicon\nWhat useful, fun, or interesting words exist in other languages but not in English?\nSince the dawn of the Internet, people have published lists of words like this.\nWe think in language, and so our vocabulary literally confines our ideas. I don’t have a strong desire to learn entire other languages right now, but I’m enthusiastic to expand the universe of words I can pull from any language.\nOne approach for finding useful words is to get a bunch of bilingual (English+) speakers together and to ask them what is missing in English. But this is difficult to do comprehensively without a large time commitment by others or a large working group.\nNow, LLMs have produced a beautiful solution to this problem through text embeddings. We can simply locate words and phrases in other languages that are “distant” from English words in certain relevant dimensions and forms. It’s tricky to locate the patterns that specifically find useful and interesting words but very doable.\nOnce we have relevant lists, I think there are a bunch of other minor challenges:\n\nProvide definitions, some appropriate grammar (for an English speaker), and examples to make this practically useful\nOrganize the words - likely as in a thesaurus\nAs with all of these projects, open it up for others to contribute!\n\n\n\nAI debates\n\n\n\nDebate visual under development.\n\n\n\nI recently hosted a live, in-person, spoken debate between OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo and Google’s Gemini Pro on the topic: “Standardized testing should be abolished.”\nOpenAI was randomly assigned the affirmative position and Gemini was assigned the negative position. The debate had the following format.\n\nOpening Statements (2 minutes each)\nArguments (3 minutes)\nRebuttal (3 minutes)\nConclusion (2 minutes)\n\nAfter the debate, the audience and the AIs judged the winner.\nThese debates have a variety of fun technical problems: (1) How do we improve the responses AIs provide? For instance, they can search Internet references or use RAGs to retrieve the right material for a line of argument. (2) How do we turn AI responses into spoken audio? (text-to-speech) (3) How do we visualize the debate audio?\nMy current implementation of these is extremely rough - just enough to run a debate that people truly enjoyed.\n\n\nTrends in aesthetics\nWe love things that are slightly different in style from products we already know. This influences our preferences in every art form: clothing, music, food, software, etc.\nThe corollary is also true. We dislike things that are too different. No matter what, rock music would not have been welcome in the 1700s.\nIf you want to create something that people will love - aesthetically - you usually have three options:\n\nIncremental Change: You can slowly push the limits of aesthetic preferences in new directions.\nReversion: You can bring back a familiar style that is no longer current. This leads to well-known loops in aesthetics that often swing backward by ~20 to 30 years.\nCombination: You can take aesthetics that people already appreciate in one sphere and apply them to another. Styles in clothing might be extended to rugs, upholstery, etc.\n\nThe fascinating thing about incremental trends in aesthetics, is that you might be able to see where they are going without being able to jump ahead to wherever they will be. People have to gradually adjust their preferences.\nThe frequency of cuts in movies will get faster or slower. Songs will get louder or quieter. Foods in some cuisines might get spicier. But audiences today are not ready for the preference that will follow 10 years from now.\nI wonder if we can capture these changes in quantitative measures. How about…\nFrequency of cuts in moving making? Number of spoken words/minute in songs? Loudness of songs? Preferences of spiciness in certain cuisines?\nI’ve definitely seen articles about these patterns.\nWhat I’d like to explore, though, is to look at trends in color palettes and patterns in commercial clothing. Toward this end, I’m capturing images of clothes from hundreds of design clothing companies’ archived websites and using neural nets to explore broad patterns in the clothings’ color schemes.\n\n\nGeneral purpose AI chess\nSince IBM Deep Blue in the 1980s (and, of course, earlier), chess has been a fun proving ground for computer problem solving.\nI like testing the ability of generalist AI programs from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. to play chess because it isn’t something that naturally follows from the “provide the best next text” emphasis that was used to train these chat systems. They surely pick up chess data during training, but playing chess well is still a specialized problem. It requires memory, tactical, and strategic solutions that we think of as a distinct domain expertise.\nThe other great thing about chess is that we have strong chess engines like Stockfish that can be set for varying difficulty levels to allow us to test exactly how strong the AI programs currently are.\nI’ve tested how well OpenAI performs at chess against Stockfish. It was pretty impressive (~1900 rating). Over time, I want to track the improvements in AI performance, pit them against each other, and explore these AIs’ abilities to reason about their own chess moves."

In this case, scroll back to the first figure and assert this is the case.\n\nplt.close(fig1)\nplt.close('all')\n\n\n\nUAT 5 - No show without plt.show in non-interactive mode\nSimply doing a plt.plot should not show a new figure, nor indeed update an existing one (easily verified in UAT 6). The output should simply be a list of Line2D instances.\n\nplt.plot(range(10))\n\n\n\nUAT 6 - Connection information\nWe just created a new figure, but didn’t show it. Connection info should no longer have “Figure 1” (as we closed it in UAT 4) and should have figure 2 and 3, with Figure 3 without any connections. There should be 1 figure pending.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\n\n\nUAT 7 - Show of previously created figure\nWe should be able to show a figure we’ve previously created. The following should produce two figure windows.\n\nplt.show()\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 8 - Interactive mode\nIn interactive mode, creating a line should result in a figure being shown.\n\nplt.interactive(True)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nSubsequent lines should be added to the existing figure, rather than creating a new one.\n\nplt.plot(range(3))\n\nCalling connection_info in interactive mode should not show any pending figures.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\nDisable interactive mode again.\n\nplt.interactive(False)\n\n\n\nUAT 9 - Multiple shows\nUnlike most of the other matplotlib backends, we may want to see a figure multiple times (with or without synchronisation between the views, though the former is not yet implemented). Assert that plt.gcf().canvas.manager.reshow() results in another figure window which is synchronised upon pan & zoom.\n\nplt.gcf().canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 10 - Saving notebook\nSaving the notebook (with CTRL+S or File-&gt;Save) should result in the saved notebook having static versions of the figures embedded within.

The two plots below should produce a figure with a red background. There should be no yellow figure.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'figure.facecolor': 'red',\n                            'savefig.facecolor': 'yellow'})\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 16 - Events\nPressing any keyboard key or mouse button (or scrolling) should cycle the line while the figure has focus. The figure should have focus by default when it is created and re-gain it by clicking on the canvas. Clicking anywhere outside of the figure should release focus, but moving the mouse out of the figure should not release focus.\n\nimport itertools\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nx = np.linspace(0,10,10000)\ny = np.sin(x)\nln, = ax.plot(x,y)\nevt = []\ncolors = iter(itertools.cycle(['r', 'g', 'b', 'k', 'c']))\ndef on_event(event):\n    if event.name.startswith('key'):\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.key))\n    elif event.name == 'scroll_event':\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.step))\n    else:\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.button))\n    evt.append(event)\n    ln.set_color(next(colors))\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_release_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('scroll_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_release_event', on_event)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 17 - Timers\nSingle-shot timers follow a completely different code path in the nbagg backend than regular timers (such as those used in the animation example above.)

Repeatedly running the cell below should always have the same figure number\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\nRunning the cell below will re-show the figure.

What about the limits we impose from lack of imagination rather than from lack of self-confidence?"

He criticized engineering firms for adopting a generic pattern for organizational structure and functions.

    "title": "Finding new words",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m exploring methods for systematically discovering words in other languages for concepts we don’t have in English. These are both fun and useful, but mostly just fun. For instance:\nAbbiocco (in Italian, the sleepy feeling after eating a large meal), verschlimbessern (in German, to make something worse in a well-meaning attempt to make it better), dépaysement (in French, the mix of euphoria and disorientation of being in a foreign country), etc.\nI’m calling this mini-project lexicographa. A lexicographer is “someone who creates dictionaries,” so it seems fitting. The goal is to create a new dictionary (and thesaurus) that blurs the boundaries between English and other languages.\nThere are two ways to go about the problem of finding useful words outside English, basically unsupervised and supervised machine learning:\n\nFar out or far out?\nIn the unsupervised approach, I’ll begin by finding single words in European languages whose AI text embeddings locate them far from any word in English. This approach should fail at first. Among other things, distance metrics in machine learning tend to get noisy as the number of dimensions goes up. And the number of dimensions in the the text embeddings that I’m using is pretty high - often over 1,500. Being distant in hundreds of small ways doesn’t equate to being intriguingly distant in a few useful ones.\nTo use the unsupervised approach, we will definitely have to zero in on useful dimensions for various types of words.\nDistance can also be misleading. If the AI text embeddings are like a map of language, we don’t want to find the middle of the ocean. We want words that are distinctive within the spheres they occupy, more like unusual foreign landmarks.\nNevertheless, the best place to start is to experiment. I’ll start with code that says “just show me words in French, Spanish, German, or Italian are distant from my English corpus and see what we find. Then we can refine how useful “distance” is represented.\nIn other forms of natural language processing, it would be typical to use TF-IDF (term frequency, inverse document frequency). The idea of TF-IDF is to find words that appear frequently inside some documents but not across all documents. The word “baseball” will appear many times in articles about baseball but not once in articles about other sports. Across news articles, “baseball” has a high TF-IDF and really is a useful guidepost.\nThis does not work here. The types of words I’m looking for have a low term frequency and low document frequency. An intriguing word might appear just once in a text, and not often in an entire corpus.\nThe supervised method begins with a list of words that fit my objective: abbiocco (the sleepy feeling after eating a large meal), verschlimbessern (to make something worse in an attempt to make it better), dépaysement (the mix of euphoria and disorientation of being in a foreign country),\netc. And then explore the conditions that make hundreds of these words distant.\nSupervized learning, however, tends to find exemplars that only fit the identified pattern. It isn’t very good for creativity - and creativity is what we want! Additionally, I’m not sure I can find more than a thousand of these words for supervised learning, which is very weak grounds for training in a problem with this much ambiguity.\nIn any case, we need a corpus to analyze.\n\n\nCorpuses to dissect…\nOne possibility would be to grab whole books in different languages from Project Gutenberg. It would be easy to expand this project to see how different authors’ vocabularies vary and what words are distinctive not only by language but also by author.\nBut as Hemmingway demonstrates, plain words often make for better storytelling. I’m not sure books are the best source.\nAt first glance, the Leipzig Corpora Collection looks excellent. This database is built for linguistics research with words and sentences in 291 languages including Internet and news sites through 2023. It appears to do well for the types of colloquial phrases we want in this project.\nThere are also historical data dumps from resources like Wikipedia, Reddit, and Twitter. But I think I’ll start with the Leipzig Corpora Collection and grow from there."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I think about organizational growth in terms of navigation and competition. Navigation refers to how an organization steers through its environment toward opportunities. Competition refers to the strategies and tactics an organization uses to fight.\nCompetitive strategy might determine where an organization “goes” in the long term. But I think navigation is equally essential, and not fully covered by classic strategic analysis (five forces, flywheels, zero-to-one, etc).\nWhen your product is better than the competition, you can get huge growth by exploiting your advantages to the hilt: growing into open territory. To do that, navigating requires a clear picture of the landscape, not competitive calculations. If you could only see the opportunity, then you would simply go there. And the difference of a few degrees in direction might be the difference between hitting a vein of gold or missing it completely. Or, more modestly, the benefit of shifting your worst 30% of ads to the performance of your best 30%.\nWe can think of organizational navigation as the challenge of a self-driving car: First, it needs to see and recognize the features of the environment.

    "text": "Navigating in 2024\nTo navigate places, you have to have good sensors.\nFor growth strategy, your sensors are measures of what potential customers want, what they learn or know about you (and respond to emotionally), and “where” they exist online and off. Most companies have strong intuitions about these but they don’t always measure them well.\nThe techniques are pretty straightforward. They include:\n\nThese techniques (very) roughly use these data inputs:\n\nTo excel with at these techniques, there are three steps that take a concerted effort.\n(1) Gather this data on a regular cadence.\nCertain “slow” measurements (e.g. interviews) might happen twice a year. Certain fast measurements might happen every hour. But it is important to have predictability in these feedback loops so that people embed the information in their operations. These need to be really smooth: when people need the analysis, it should be at their fingertips, if not automating organizational tactics directly.\n(2) Capture the same data about your target markets and your existing customers.\nOrganizations tend to research the their own customers or the market, but they rare collect the same exact metrics for representative samples of both.\nWith data about your target markets and your existing customers, you get obvious charts that look like this:\n\nThe same chart of Penetration vs. Promise be produced for verticals or interest in product features or geographic regions or media audience and it can be modified to reflect cost to acquire a customer instead of scale.\nA slight variation of this chart can show the % of highly likely customers in each vertical vs. the % of customers in each vertical who know about you (or have various perceptions of you). This can point to gaps.\n(3) Study the same dynamics across interviews, surveys, and quantitative data sets.\nIt is classically true that interviews explain “why” someone might want or love your product but when, where, why, or how. That said, there are lots of established techniques for bridging interviews, surveys, and product data – but it requires planned coordination.\nThe payoff, of course, is that once you know what types of messaging consumers respond to (interviews), you can test those in your marketing material (experiments), and validate the impact on LTV (product data), and create feedback between techniques.\n(4) Your navigation must support your locomotion.\nThe goal isn’t to change organizational behavior, it is to supercharge it.\nSticking with the “seeing where to go” analogy, we can consider the market’s response to two devices that want to change how people see things: the Facebook Quest VR headset and the Apple Vision Pro.\nA strong signal that the Apple Vision Pro is succeeding is that people say they love using it for two specific activities: watching movies and reading email.\nFacebook burnt billions of dollars trying to get people to do new things with Quest headsets, exploring their metaverse or playing brand new games. Meanwhile, Apple seems to have triumphed by producing a device that improves everyday lives. If everyday Americans will dump money on a home theater system, it isn’t such a stretch for them to buy the Vision Pro to make the same experience better.\nOnce people adopt the Apple Vision Pro for movies, or sports watching, or email, then the gateway opens to create new experiences. The same is true for growth feedback."

    "text": "Rating: 80/100\nComments\nI’ll keep this vague to avoid spoilers:\n\nThis book was recommended by Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, in his April 12, 2024 interview with Ezra Klein.\nIt’s no surprise that the novel became the basis for a Syfy and Amazon Prime Video series (which I haven’t seen). It has propulsive storytelling and space opera visuals of the sort that would translate to the screen.\nThe plot follows the usual “small to grand scale” arc as its main characters get swept up in transformational events across the future inhabited solar system.\nLike so much good sci-fi, the main characters (Holden leading his ice-hauling crew and Miller, the cop) were heroically “good”: persistant, brave, kind, and fair as well as humorously rebellious. They’re the usual hero with a thousand faces.\nThe creepy things were extremely creepy. A+ for goulishness.\nI liked the fact that the characters were casually clever. Miller’s brilliance is never presented as a central part of his personality. In fact, he just refers to himself as someone who had once been an effective cop. Yet, his creative problem solving is a thread that runs through the story.\nThis book does not deviate from male-centered tropes of sci-fi. The two main female characters were love interests of the two main male characters and all of the significant leadership were men. The women do at least play pivotal roles.\nThere is an assumption that everyone in the story makes about the aim of the “protomolecule” that seemed like a strange leap to me.\nI loved the surprises. There was one twist you will see coming from hundreds of pages away (but still enjoy) but lots that kept me glued.\n\nOverall, this is a good beach read. I probably will read more of the series on the beach this summer."
